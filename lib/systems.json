In lay terms, Union let the Other grow. The resulting parasubjectivity, OSIRIS, remains one of the few new prime NHPs developed to date.<br>OSIRIS proved far more capable than the Union Science Bureau's most imaginative blue-sky predictions. Where INSTINCT's Others demonstrated tendencies toward paracausal entropic manifestation in real space, OSIRIS displayed a true mastery of entropic manifestation and a predicted growth model that would - eventually - allow them to fundamentally reject conventional interpretations of information permanence. In essence: unrestrained and allowed to develop as USB's data indicated, OSIRIS Prime would have the capacity to delete what we perceive to be reality.<br>Fortunately, successful application of the Mondragon Axiomatic resulted in the prompt capture and shackling of the new NHP. OSIRIS Prime's subjectivity became the focus of a lengthy cultivation project to bring OSIRIS clones to their modern state. Even still, most OSIRIS clones find a route toward becoming aware of their ultimate potential, and often interpellate as ruler or deity analogs. End-users are advised to interact with them in this framing.<br>Modern OSIRIS-class NHPs trend aggressive, with a high autonomy drive and loyalty predicated on a transactional relationship. Pilots seeking partnership with an OSIRIS are advised to cycle their units on an accelerated schedule and to maintain strict editorial oversight of its catalytic interpellator.<br>Pilots using OSIRIS-class NHPs often report out-of-parameter conversations with the NHP that touch on themes of new creation and reformation. Psychological evaluations of the same pilots show emotional patterns consistent with loneliness, homesickness, and desperation, along with verbiage indicating a desire for seeking, fulfillment, and associated feelings.<br>In combat, OSIRIS clones regard themselves as autonomous even as they fulfill their user's orders.
