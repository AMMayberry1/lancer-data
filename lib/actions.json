Many pilots choose NHP (non-human person) assistants or more conventional comp/con units to help them with these tasks. All mechs have access to the basic tech actions. Further tech actions can be enhanced by taking systems that upgrade them.</p> <p>Some tech actions are <strong>attacks</strong> (often called <strong>tech attacks</strong>) and benefit from generic bonuses to attack rolls. All tech actions must choose a target within <strong>Sensor Range</strong> to be effective, and roll <strong>tech attack vs. e-defense</strong>. By default, tech attack is boosted by your mech&rsquo;s systems. To use a tech action, choose a target in your sensor range (including yourself) and choose one of the following options:</p> <p><strong>Bolster</strong> <br />You use the formidable core processing power of your mech&rsquo;s systems to boost one other target&rsquo;s systems. That target can take +2 Accuracy on its next skill check or save of any kind before the end of its next turn. A mech can only benefit from bolster once at a time.</p> <p><strong> Scan</strong> <br /><p>You can use your mech&rsquo;s powerful internal systems to deep scan your enemies.<br />To <strong>Scan</strong>, choose a character or object in sensor range, then ask the GM for one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Your target&rsquo;s full statistics (HP, Speed, Evasion, Armor, HASE, etc), weapons, and systems</li> <li>Hidden information about the target, such as information caches it is carrying, current mission, pilot ID, etc.</li> <li>Generic or public information about the target that could be pulled from an infobank, records, etc, such as the model number of a mech</li> </ul> <p>This information is only current when you receive it (for example, if the target loses HP again, your information won&rsquo;t update).</p> <p><strong>Lock On</strong> <br />Choose a character in your sensor range and line of sight. That character gains the Lock On condition, enabling some systems and talents. A hostile attacker can consume Lock On on a character when they make an attack roll against them to gain +1 Accuracy on that attack.</p> <p><strong>Invade</strong><br /><p>Make a <strong>tech attack</strong> against a character in range. On success, your target takes <strong>2 heat</strong>.</p> <p>Many pieces of mech gear give you options when you successfully Invade other characters. Each time you Invade successfully, your target takes heat and you can choose one of the options available to you.

Efficiency is how directly effective your organization is at what it does (a military organization with high efficiency would be good at combat, for example). Influence is your organization’s size, reach, wealth, and reputation. Influence be used to acquire assets, create opportunities, or sway public opinion. Efficiency can be used to perform activities related to your organization’s purpose (science, military, etc). You can use these advantages as <strong>reserves.</strong> </p> <p> The first time you make this downtime action, establish your organization at +2 efficiency or influence, and the other at +0. </p> <p> Each downtime afterwards, roll the following skill check (this doesn’t take a downtime action and you must make it each downtime). Triggers on this skill depend on the type of action you’re taking to further your organization (lead or inspire is one that is probably always going to trigger). </p> <p> On a total result of 9 or lower, your organization folds immediately unless: </p> <ul> <li> It lowers in efficiency and influence by 2, to a minimum of 0.
