On penetration, the pike's head is severed from the shaft - moments later, the embedded pike head detonates in a conical explosion from the point forward. Spare thermal charges are stable, and transported in external tube magazines.<br>IPS-N also makes thermal charges compatible with GMS's range of blades, hammers, and picks.",

To put it simply, phase-ready rounds, when fired, exist in two places at once: exiting the barrel of the weapon they were fired from, and directly in front of the target, prior to impact.
